Tired of staring at a Russian flag while your country is being invaded by the Russian army, but still need to type with different keyboards including the Russian character set? Then just install `Russian (Ukraine).bundle`! You probably need to log out and log in again and then you may choose the layout under System Preferences->Keyboard->Input Sources.

    git clone git@github.com:alexcom/Russian-for-Ukraine.git
    cd Russian-for-Ukraine/
    open .
    click Russian (Ukraine).bundle

### Modify the layout ###
